    title: 'Scope of this Privacy Policy',
    body:
      'This Privacy Policy applies to XapZap services made available through the website, mobile app, Flutter web experience, and supporting platform infrastructure. It explains how XapZap collects, uses, stores, discloses, protects, and deletes information when users browse public pages, create accounts, publish content, interact with other users, or contact support.',

  {
    title: 'Information we collect',
    body:
      'XapZap may collect account data such as email address, username, display name, date of birth, country, gender, profile biography, avatar, and cover image. We also collect user-generated content and platform interaction data such as posts, comments, likes, follows, saves, reports, blocks, moderation events, and account actions. Technical and operational information may include IP address, session timestamps, device details, browser details, app version details, crash data, and performance signals needed to run the service responsibly.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How we use information',
    body:
      'We use information to create and authenticate accounts, deliver public and personalized content, display profiles, enable posting and commenting, investigate reports, enforce moderation rules, secure the platform, detect fraud or abuse, maintain service performance, and comply with legal obligations. We may also use operational signals to improve reliability, ranking quality, abuse detection, and user safety systems.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How data may be shared',
    body:
      'Public profile information, public posts, comments, and public engagement signals may be visible to other users according to product design. XapZap may also use infrastructure and service providers for authentication, storage, networking, hosting, delivery, logging, and security support. Supported traffic is expected to be encrypted in transit through HTTPS or TLS.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Moderation, safety, and abuse prevention',
    body:
      'Reports, blocks, moderation decisions, and abuse indicators may be processed to detect harassment, hate speech, impersonation, scams, spam, sexual exploitation, coordinated abuse, and other prohibited behavior. We may retain relevant moderation information where reasonably necessary for trust and safety review, repeat-offender detection, security investigations, legal compliance, and dispute handling.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Deletion and retention',
    body:
      'Signed-in users can permanently delete their account through the supported deletion flow. XapZap attempts to remove the profile, posts, comments, likes, follows, saves, blocks, reports, and related account records immediately when deletion succeeds. Limited residual technical, safety, or legal records may remain only where necessary for propagation, fraud prevention, security review, moderation history, dispute handling, or legal compliance. XapZap should not promise a fixed auto-delete period for any retained record unless that retention workflow is actually enforced in production.',
  },
  {
    title: 'User rights and choices',
    body:
      'Users may update profile information, block accounts, report content, and use the supported account deletion flow. Depending on applicable law, users may also have rights to request access, correction, erasure, objection, or restriction relating to certain personal data. Requests may be limited where exceptions apply under law or where identity verification is required.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Children and age restrictions',
    body:
      'XapZap is not intended for users below the minimum legal age in their jurisdiction. If XapZap learns that an account was created in violation of age requirements, the account and related content may be restricted or removed.',

    title: 'International use',
    body:
      'Users may access XapZap from multiple countries and regions. Information may be processed in locations where XapZap or its infrastructure providers operate. XapZap seeks to apply reasonable safeguards consistent with the providers and systems it uses.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Policy updates',
    body:
      'XapZap may update this Privacy Policy as the product, moderation systems, infrastructure, and legal obligations evolve. Updated versions may be published on the website, in the app, or both. Continued use of the service after an effective date means the user accepts the revised policy to the extent permitted by law.',
